     <p>Rich, golden color with dark amber and orange hues and a touch of chill haze that clears as the beer warms. Carbonation is quite active, with abnormally large bubbles frothing into a thick white foam head that piles high, sticks and leaves a healthy lacing. Steely and mineral in the nose, soft and powdery, with a dusting of herbal and malty-sweet suggestions. Very smooth on the palate; even and medium-bodied. Malty with bready and biscuity notes running through a light and toasty sweetness. An aggressive alcohol cuts through with spice and a burn, prickling the palate. Distinct herbal hops characters meet the alcohol spice and meld well. Faint taste of ripe stone fruit beneath. Toasty finish, slightly drying, powdery dash of spices.

    The beer pours hazed amber, topped with a very tightly laced creamy head. This traps some biscuity tannin aromas for the nose, framed with floral and wood. Very smooth upfront, and a bit creamy in mouthfeel. The malty body flexes with a full and even bready sweetness and doughy and soapy edges. A citric bite throws down on the taste buds with some herbal spice, flower pith, leaf, and some oily stick, with piney notes. Loads of fruit presence, like a fruit mélange of blood orange and grapefruit steeped in a rose-hip peel tea-like character. An aggressive spicy alcohol presence waits beneath, hitting the head with a warming sensation that targets the forehead region and numbness forming in the temples. A deep oak flavor comes about towards the finish, and especially throughout as the beer warms. A very distinct and subdued dry and semi-tangy flavor that is pulled from the oak and is a bit vinous at times, layers this beer with much depth. Suggestions of vanilla as the beer warms, with hints of brown sugar sweetness. Bready and soapy lingers.</p>

      <p>The 11.2-ounce stubby bottle pours a muddy copper with a creamy and frothy beige head and sticky retention. Decanted carefully to keep the dregs (which are plentiful) from pouring out of the bottle. Yeasty, lightly vegetal, metallic, with a subtle spiciness and sweet alcohol in the nose. Light on the palate, with a prickly carbonation and creaminess in its wake. Delicious dark fruitiness of cherries, raisins and ripe plums. Very malty, with undertones of sweet chocolate, mild coffee and caramelized sugars. Crisp, dry edge. Spicy alcohol, a splash of coriander, and a slight tartness that helps tease and tame the sweetness. Soft, drying, powdery feel in the finish. Incredibly moore-ish as in, why, yes we'd love to have another. And with a very deceptive 11 percent alcohol by volume, we will.

      This Russian Imperial Stout is dedicated to Georgy Zhukov, arguably one of the finest generals of World War II. Opaque black in color, with notes of espresso, chocolate, dark toffee and hints of backstrap molasses. The English hop varietals provide a subtle herbal dryness, and finishes with a hearty slap of roasty espresso. Pair Marshal Zhukov’s with Mushroom Solyanka, dark chocolate, cherries and ground wars in Russia. We brew and release Zhukov's in the summer knowing that a beer of this heft reaches its full potential a few months after release. So save a bottle for the cold winter!</p>
